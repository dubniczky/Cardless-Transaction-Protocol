More and more online purchases revolve arount subscription models. All of this with the implicit trust that the vendors will take the correct amount of money each time. Canceling subscriptions usually involves a tedious process of answering surveys and finding the correct options hidden on the vendor's page. They might also store those banking details and use them afterward, increasing them as a target for potential hackers. With card payments, it is trivial to steal funds or impersonate users in case of a breach.

Our proposal is a new, unified cardless banking standard, where vendors are issued a token, allowing them to use each for pre-approved transactions. In this thesis, we are creating our own standard solution to this problem and substatniate it with a demo system with guidelines for implementation.
